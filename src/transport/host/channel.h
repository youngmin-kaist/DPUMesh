/*
 * Host view of the DPUMesh transport. This is the only header that both the
 * carrier (src/core) and the DPUMesh transport sources are visible from; it
 * exposes no DOCA or DPUMesh types, so the carrier compiles against the public
 * core alone.
 *
 * Two reverse paths share this interface, selected per device by DPUMESH_REVERSE:
 *   push (default)  DPU -> host bytes are pushed by the DPU's DMA engine into
 *                   the connection's window (slot ring + data ring); no host DPA
 *                   and no doorbell for the data, so the consumer polls the window
 *   pull            the mirror of the forward path: a host-owned DPA thread per
 *                   connection polls the DPU's descriptor ring and copies
 *                   tx_staging into the window's data area. DPUMESH_HOST_DPA_PCI names
 *                   the host PF that runs the DPA process (its vhca needs a DPA
 *                   EU partition); DPUMESH_HOST_DPA_DEV optionally extends that
 *                   process to an SF (ibdev name) that then owns the DPA objects

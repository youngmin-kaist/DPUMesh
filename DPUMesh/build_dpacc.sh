# This script uses the dpacc tool (located in /opt/mellanox/doca/tools/dpacc) to compile DPA kernels device code.
# This script takes 4 arguments:
# arg1: The project's build path (for the DPA Device build)
# arg2: Absolute paths of all DPA (kernel) device source code *files* (our code)
# arg3: The sample name
# arg4: The output DPACC sample program name

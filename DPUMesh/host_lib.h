/*
 * libdmesh_host: the host-side DMA channel as a byte-stream library, so an
 * application (e.g. a Go gRPC service through cgo) can dial/serve through the
 * DPU proxy directly instead of splicing through a TCP bridge process.
 *
 * A channel wraps one comch connection + one push-transport DMA channel
 * (안 2: no host DPA, freely replicable per process/thread). Modes:
 *   2 (INGRESS_PUSH): client semantics — the DPU proxy serves this flow
 *     through its outbound L7 stack (dial side).
 *   1 (BACKEND): this process is a backend provider for (dst_ip, dst_port);
 *     the proxy connects through the channel instead of dialing TCP.
 *
 * Threading: one channel may be used by one reader thread and one writer
 * thread concurrently (an internal mutex serializes the shared progress
 * engine). Read/write are non-blocking; the caller drives its own backoff.
